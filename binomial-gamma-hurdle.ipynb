    "### Model description\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent variable, a number of animals observed per minute (y) is semi-continuous (i.e. a point mass in a single value and a continuous distribution elsewhere). The data generating process for this type of data can be modelled using a gamma distribution. The main problem is however that response variable has a high proportion of zeros (96%), which is more than expected from a gamma distribution with, therefore it cannot be readily applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets consider the two common methods for dealing with zero-inflated data:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Modelling a zero-inflation parameter that represents the probability a given 0 comes from the main distribution (say the negative binomial distribution) or is an excess 0;\n",
    "(2) Modelling the zero and non-zero data with one model and then modelling the non-zero data with another. This is often called a hurdle model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In (1), the response variable is modelled as a mixture of a Bernoulli distribution (a point mass at zero) and a Poisson distribution (or any other count distribution supported on non-negative integers).\n",
    "In (2), the basic idea is that a Bernoulli probability governs the binary outcome of whether a variable has a zero or positive realization. If the realization is positive, the hurdle is crossed, and the conditional distribution of the positives is governed by a truncated-at-zero model. Hurdle models model the zeros and non-zeros as two separate processes and can be useful in that they allow you to model the zeros and non-zeros with different predictors or different roles of the same predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-inflation models may be more elegant and informative if the same predictors are thought to contribute to the extra and real zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hurdle models can be useful in that they allow you to model the zeros and non-zeros with different predictors or different roles of the same predictors. Maybe one process leads to the zero/non-zero data and another leads to the non-zero magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we shall focus on (2) and model the zeros separately from the non-zeros in a binomial-Gamma hurdle model.\n"
